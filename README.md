GiPSo is using Discource as its online community platform.

Part of the platform is open for everyone. Another part is closed for members of the community. You're a member of the community if you're part of a project that is sustained by GiPSo.
Hence, projects have a membership ID.

This plugin creates two custom fields for groups:

- gipsomembership_id (text) 
- membershipfee_paid (boolean)
